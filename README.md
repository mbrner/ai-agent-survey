## Papers

- [**Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools**](./toolformer): Self-supervised language model that is trained to use external APIs, thereby bridging the gap between large-scale language models' abilities to solve complex tasks and their struggles with basic functionalities like arithmetic or factual lookup.
- [**ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**](./react): The paper presents REACT, a model that enhances the capabilities of large language models by synergistically generating reasoning traces and task-specific actions, thereby improving performance on language and decision-making tasks, as well as increasing human interpretability and trustworthiness.
- [**Plan-and-Solve Prompting: Improving Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning by Large Language Models**](./plan-and-solve): The study introduces Plan-and-Solve Prompting, a new approach that improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models by breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, planning and solving them sequentially.
- [**Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs**](./gorilla): A fine-tuned LLM that excels at writing API calls significantly improves the accuracy of API usage and reduces hallucination errors, proving its potential to increase the reliability and applicability of LLM output.
- [**HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face**](./huggingface-gpt): A multi-model collaborative system that automates tasks by leveraging various machine learning models from Hugging Face, using a four-stage pipeline of task planning, model selection, task execution, and response generation controlled by an LLM.
- [**Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models**](./voyager): The paper introduces an LLM-powered agent designed for lifelong learning in Minecraft, which proposes tasks based on its skills and state, refines skills based on environmental feedback, and continually explores the world.
