**TL;DR: a**

### Summary

The paper discusses the paradox of language models (LMs) that show the ability to solve new tasks from just a few examples or textual instructions, especially at scale, but struggle with basic functionality, such as arithmetic or factual lookup, where simpler and smaller models excel.

The authors introduce a model, "Toolformer," that is trained to decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. This is done in a self-supervised way, requiring nothing more than a handful of demonstrations for each API. They incorporate a range of tools, including a calculator.
