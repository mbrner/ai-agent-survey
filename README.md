## Papers

- [**Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools**](./toolformer): Self-supervised language model that is trained to use external APIs, thereby bridging the gap between large-scale language models' abilities to solve complex tasks and their struggles with basic functionalities like arithmetic or factual lookup.
- [**ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**](./react): The paper presents REACT, a model that enhances the capabilities of large language models by synergistically generating reasoning traces and task-specific actions, thereby improving performance on language and decision-making tasks, as well as increasing human interpretability and trustworthiness.
