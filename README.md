## Papers

- [**Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools**](./toolformer): Self-supervised language model that is trained to use external APIs, thereby bridging the gap between large-scale language models' abilities to solve complex tasks and their struggles with basic functionalities like arithmetic or factual lookup.
- [**ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**](./react): The paper presents REACT, a model that enhances the capabilities of large language models by synergistically generating reasoning traces and task-specific actions, thereby improving performance on language and decision-making tasks, as well as increasing human interpretability and trustworthiness.
- [**Plan-and-Solve Prompting: Improving Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning by Large Language Models**](./plan-and-solve): The study introduces Plan-and-Solve Prompting, a new approach that improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models by breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, planning and solving them sequentially.
