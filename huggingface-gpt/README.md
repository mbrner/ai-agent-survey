## Summary

The authors present an autonomous system that collaborates with various machine learning models to automate tasks. HuggingGPT is a pipeline consisting of four stages: task planning, model selection, task execution, and response generation. The system can support a broad range of tasks in language, vision, audio, and more, by utilizing models from the Hugging Face hub. It uses GPT-4 as an evaluator to assess its planning capabilities. The paper also details the use of local inference endpoints alongside cloud-based ones for better efficiency and stability. The document presents several case studies showing the system's proficiency in handling various tasks, including complex and multi-modal ones.
