## Summary

**TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaGPT, a novel framework for large language model-based multi-agent systems that integrates Standardized Operating Procedures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in collaborative software engineering tasks and demonstrating potential for complex problem-solving and a pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence.**

Despite advancements in automated task-solving through multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs), these systems often oversimplify real-world complexities and struggle with effective collaboration. This is due to the LLM hallucination problem and the lack of coherent interactions, unproductive feedback loops, and meaningful collaborative engagements. Prior works have explored using multiple LLMs in a collaborative setting to solve complex tasks, with the motivation that cross-agent interaction can collectively enhance performance by aggregating their strengths.

### Approach

We introduce MetaGPT, a novel framework that incorporates human workflows and Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. MetaGPT is built upon a two-layer architectural design: the foundational components layer, essential for agent operations and system-wide communication, and the collaboration layer, which facilitates agent coordination through key mechanisms such as knowledge sharing and workflow encapsulation. SOPs support task decomposition and efficient coordination, and outline responsibilities among team members. In MetaGPT, we equip the agent with the ability to generate standard actions output. We further introduce a new meta programming mechanism, which allows programs to manipulate other programs as data, enabling adaptive and flexible programming capabilities.
### Results

Experiments on collaborative software engineering benchmarks demonstrate that MetaGPT generates more coherent and correct solutions compared to existing chat-based multi-agent systems. These intermediate standardized outputs significantly increase the success rate of the final code execution. In code generation benchmarks, MetaGPT achieves a new state-of-the-art with 81.7% and 82.3% in Pass@1 over direct methods. Remarkably, in our experimental evaluations, we have achieved a 100% task completion rate, further underscoring the robustness and efficiency of the MetaGPT framework. The system's capabilities extend to complex system designs beyond simple game examples, such as content recommendation engines, search algorithm frameworks, and LLM-based operating systems. The architect agent generates a detailed system-level diagram illustrating the software architecture, providing specific and practical information that can aid in the implementation of engineering projects.
### Conclusion

Our research outlines a transformative paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent systems by integrating SOPs. MetaGPT exemplifies the potential of meta programming, particularly within the LLM-based multi-agent environment. This convergence of structured processes, agent collaboration, and advanced model-driven techniques is transforming the landscape of software development. The significant contributions of our endeavor include the introduction of a meta programming framework, integration of human SOP process design, and achieving state-of-the-art performance. The project's GitHub repository is publicly available for further exploration and application. The MetaGPT framework is a versatile and powerful approach to designing and implementing intelligent agents with specialized capabilities. These agents, with the help of role features, can effectively collaborate, learn, adapt, and perform various tasks, making them valuable assets in a wide range of applications and domains. The standardized outputs in MetaGPT offer a powerful tool for handling complex tasks, promoting collaborative consistency, reducing the need for excessive dialogue turns, and enhancing the ability of LLM-based multi-agent systems to administer and execute complex tasks more effectively. In comparison to other frameworks like AutoGPT, LangChain, and AgentVerse, MetaGPT distinguishes itself through its wide-ranging functionality, including unique capabilities such as generating PRDs and technical designs, API interface generation, code review, precompilation execution, and role-based task management. This makes MetaGPT a more comprehensive and robust solution for project execution. Despite the immense potential of MetaGPT in automating end-to-end processes, it also has several limitations. Primarily, it occasionally references non-existent resource files like images and audio. Furthermore, during the execution of complex tasks, it is prone to invoking undefined or unimported classes or variables. Our illustrative example in software development showcases the potential of this framework through detailed SOPs and prompts. The experimental results demonstrate that our MetaGPT can produce comprehensive solutions with higher coherence compared to existing conversational and chat-based multi-agent systems. We believe that this work opens up new possibilities for the way multi-agents interact and cooperate, redefines the landscape of complex problem-solving, and points to a potential pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence.
