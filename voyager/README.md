## Summary

**TL;DR: VOYAGER, the first Large Language Model powered lifelong learning agent in Minecraft, demonstrates superior performance in exploration, skill acquisition, and task completion, outperforming prior state-of-the-art by leveraging an automatic curriculum, a skill library, and a self-verification module, setting a new benchmark for AI performance in open-ended worlds.**

The paper introduces VOYAGER, the first Large Language Model (LLM) powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft, an open-ended game with infinite possibilities. The agent is designed to emulate human players' capabilities in the game, such as continuous exploration, skill acquisition, and making novel discoveries without human intervention. The challenge lies in enabling the agent to explore, plan, and develop new skills in such open-ended worlds, a task that has been a grand challenge for the AI community.

### Approach

VOYAGER is composed of three key components: an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration, a skill library for storing and retrieving complex behaviors, and a new iterative prompting mechanism that generates executable code for embodied control. The automatic curriculum leverages the internet-scale knowledge contained within GPT-4, providing a steady stream of new tasks or challenges in a bottom-up fashion, fostering curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation for the agent to learn and explore. The agent interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, eliminating the need for model parameter fine-tuning. This approach allows the agent to progressively acquire, update, accumulate, and transfer knowledge over extended time spans, similar to how a human player would adapt to different situations in the game. The agent incrementally builds a skill library by storing the action programs that help solve a task successfully. Each program is indexed by the embedding of its description, which can be retrieved in similar situations in the future. Complex skills can be synthesized by composing simpler programs, which compounds VOYAGER’s capabilities rapidly over time and alleviates catastrophic forgetting in other continual learning methods. The iterative prompting mechanism executes the generated program, incorporates feedback into GPT-4’s prompt for code refinement, and repeats the process until a self-verification module confirms the task completion. This self-verification module, another instance of GPT-4, acts as a critic, checking task success and reflecting on mistakes. Additionally, a warm-up schedule is adopted to gradually incorporate the agent’s state and the additional context into the prompt based on how many tasks the agent has completed. This ensures that the prompt is exposed to increasing amounts of information over the exploration progress and therefore begins with basic skills and progressively advances towards more intricate and diverse ones.
### Results

VOYAGER demonstrates strong in-context lifelong learning capability and exceptional proficiency in playing Minecraft. It obtains 3.3× more unique items, travels 2.3× longer distances, and unlocks key tech tree milestones up to 15.3× faster than prior state-of-the-art. Additionally, VOYAGER can utilize the learned skill library in a new Minecraft world to solve novel tasks from scratch, outperforming other techniques in generalization. This mirrors the human player's ability to propose suitable tasks based on its current skill level and world state, refine skills based on environmental feedback, and continually explore the world in a self-driven manner. In comparison to other representative algorithms such as ReAct, Reflexion, and AutoGPT, which were adapted for the Minecraft environment, VOYAGER outperforms them in terms of efficiency and mastery of the tech tree. Furthermore, VOYAGER is the only agent to unlock the diamond level of the tech tree, underscoring the effectiveness of the automatic curriculum. It also outperforms in navigating a variety of terrains, including 'plains', 'dripstone_caves', 'savanna', 'meadow', 'snowy_taiga', 'stony_shore', 'forest', 'ocean', while baseline agents often find themselves confined to local areas. In zero-shot generalization tests, VOYAGER consistently solved all tasks, while baselines could not solve any task within 50 prompting iterations. The skill library constructed from lifelong learning not only enhanced VOYAGER’s performance but also boosted AutoGPT, demonstrating its versatility and potential as a plug-and-play asset to enhance performance. Ablation studies showed that without the skill library, VOYAGER tends to plateau in later stages, highlighting the importance of the skill library in creating complex actions and pushing the agent's boundaries. The self-verification module was found to be critical, with a 73% drop in item discovery when it was removed. GPT-4 significantly outperformed GPT-3.5 in code generation, obtaining 5.7x more unique items.
## Conclusion

In conclusion, VOYAGER represents a significant advancement in the field of AI, demonstrating the potential of Large Language Models in creating embodied lifelong learning agents. Its ability to continuously learn and adapt to its environment, coupled with its proficiency in complex tasks, sets a new benchmark for AI performance in open-ended worlds like Minecraft. It effectively mimics human players' capabilities, proposing suitable tasks based on its current skill level and world state, refining skills based on environmental feedback, and continually exploring the world in a self-driven manner. Compared to other methods, VOYAGER's unique combination of an automatic curriculum, skill library, and self-verification module gives it a distinct advantage in terms of efficiency and adaptability. Ablation studies further underscored the importance of the automatic curriculum, with a 93% drop in item discovery when replaced with a random one, highlighting the need for a well-structured, adaptive learning path. However, there are limitations to consider, such as the high cost of the GPT-4 API, inaccuracies in the agent's skill generation, and hallucinations in the automatic curriculum and code generation process. Future work could explore augmenting VOYAGER with multimodal perception models to achieve more impressive tasks, as demonstrated by its ability to construct complex 3D structures in Minecraft with human feedback. Improvements in the GPT API models and novel techniques for fine-tuning open-source LLMs are expected to overcome these limitations.
