## Summary

The paper presents *VOYAGER*, an LLM-powered agent designed for lifelong learning in the open-ended world of Minecraft. *VOYAGER* autonomously explores the world, learns diverse skills, and makes novel discoveries without human intervention. It has three main components: an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration, a skill library for storing and retrieving complex behaviors, and a new iterative prompting mechanism that incorporates environmental feedback and self-verification for program improvement. The skills developed by *VOYAGER* are temporally extended, interpretable, and compositional, and it interacts with GPT-4 through blackbox queries.
